# TaskManagerApp

An mvp task management application, similar looking to trello. Created two pages, one is a dashboard with a user's projects/tasks and the other is their profile. The application allows users to sign in, create a card, display their latest assignments and add/check off tasks. Once tasks are checked off they are saved. A user is able to sign out and back in and see their stored progress. Ruby gem 'react-rails' is used to implement react's component rendering capabilities.
